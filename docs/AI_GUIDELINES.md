# AI Tool Usage Guidelines

## Our Philosophy

We encourage the use of AI tools, documentation, and any resources that help you solve problems - just like you would in a real work environment. However, we're evaluating your problem-solving skills, not the AI's.

## What We Expect

### ✅ Good AI Usage
- Using AI to understand concepts
- Getting syntax help or boilerplate code
- Debugging error messages
- Learning about best practices

### ❌ Poor AI Usage
- Copy-pasting without understanding
- Submitting code you can't explain
- Using AI-generated code that doesn't fit our requirements
- Ignoring the specific constraints of our challenge

## How We'll Evaluate

1. **Code Review**: We'll look for:
   - Consistency with our existing patterns
   - Proper handling of our specific requirements
   - Evidence of understanding edge cases

2. **Discussion Phase**: Be prepared to:
   - Explain every design decision
   - Discuss trade-offs you considered
   - Suggest improvements or alternatives
   - Debug issues live if asked

## Specific Challenge Constraints

These aspects require careful thinking beyond standard solutions:

1. **Sync Queue Ordering**: Ensure operations are applied in the correct order
2. **Batch Size Optimization**: Balance between performance and memory usage
3. **Conflict Detection**: Identify conflicts before applying last-write-wins
4. **Error Recovery**: Handle partial batch failures gracefully
5. **Data Integrity**: Ensure no data loss during sync failures

## Declaration

Please include a brief note in your README about:
- Which tools/resources you used
- Any interesting challenges you faced
- Trade-offs you considered in your implementation

Remember: In real jobs, knowing how to effectively use AI tools is a valuable skill. We want to see that you can use them wisely while still demonstrating your own understanding and problem-solving abilities.
