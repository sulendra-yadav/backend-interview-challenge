## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with UI
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - Check TypeScript types

## Your Task

### Key Implementation Files

You'll need to implement the following services and routes:

- `src/services/taskService.ts` - Task CRUD operations
- `src/services/syncService.ts` - Sync logic and conflict resolution  
- `src/routes/tasks.ts` - REST API endpoints
- `src/routes/sync.ts` - Sync-related endpoints

### Before Submission

Ensure all of these pass:
```bash
npm test          # All tests must pass
npm run lint      # No linting errors
npm run typecheck # No TypeScript errors
```

### Time Expectation

This challenge is designed to take 2-3 hours to complete.
